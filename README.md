# Score-Predictor
A notebook that calculates the score that a chasing team needs to be at a point of time to win the match. This notebook deals with the dataset of ball by baall ipl data from 2008- 2022 and predicts the score that a team needs to be at he end of 15 overs to determine whether the chasing team can win the match or not using the current score, wickets in hand and overs left. 
It can help us to determine whether the team can win or not using this algorithm.
A case study of 2 IPL teams( CSK & MI) to check their predicted score and the actual score and then predict whether the chasing team can win/lose the game using the following interactive plot.

The same problem has been hosted on a streamlit app and the probability of winning and its corresponding chart has been visualized.
